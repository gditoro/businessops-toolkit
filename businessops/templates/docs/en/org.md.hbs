# Organization & Roles

<!-- BO:BEGIN GENERATED -->
## Current / Planned Structure (High-Level)
- Lifecycle mode: **{{company.lifecycle_mode}}**
- Stage: **{{company.identity.stage}}**
- Team size: **{{company.identity.headcount_range}}**
- Packs: {{#each meta.packs}}**{{this}}**{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
- Delivery: **{{company.ops.delivery_type}}**
- Outsourcing: **{{company.ops.outsourcing_level}}**

### Outsourced services
{{#each company.ops.outsourced_services}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

### Bottleneck
{{#if company.ops.bottleneck}}
- {{company.ops.bottleneck}}
{{else}}
- [ASSUMPTION] Current bottleneck is unclear ownership + cadence.
{{/if}}

## Suggested departments (minimum executable)
> Max 6 areas. At **{{company.identity.headcount_range}}** size, treat these as “hats” (one person can own multiple).

{{#if company.org.departments}}
{{#each company.org.departments}}
### {{name}}
- **Objective:** {{objective}}
- **Owner:** {{owner}}
- **KPIs:** {{#each kpis}}`{{this}}`{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
- **Cost/complexity:** [ASSUMPTION] low–medium
- **Risk mitigated:** [ASSUMPTION] unpredictability / rework / cash risk
- **Expected impact:** [ASSUMPTION] more consistent execution

{{/each}}
{{else}}
_No structure persisted under `company.org.departments` yet._
{{/if}}

## Roles (by stage) + hiring triggers
> In **{{company.identity.stage}}/{{company.identity.headcount_range}}**, make ownership explicit even if one person wears multiple hats.

{{#if company.org.roles}}
| Role | Area | Summary | Hiring trigger | Outsource-friendly? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
{{#each company.org.roles}}
| {{name}} | {{area}} | {{summary}} | {{hiring_trigger}} | {{can_be_outsourced}} |
{{/each}}
{{else}}
_No roles persisted under `company.org.roles` yet._
{{/if}}

## Mini-RACI (super practical)
Roles:
- **DIR** = Founder/Direction
- **SAL** = Sales owner
- **OPS** = Ops owner
- **FIN** = Finance owner
- **ACC(V)** = Accounting vendor
- **3PL(V)** = Warehouse/3PL vendor (if any)
- **BROKER(V)** = Customs broker vendor (if any)

| Process | R | A | C | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lead → Qualification | SAL | SAL | DIR | FIN, OPS |
| Proposal / Pricing | SAL | DIR | FIN | OPS |
| Order confirmation | SAL | SAL | OPS | FIN |
| Invoicing / Taxes | FIN | FIN | ACC(V), SAL | OPS |
| Fulfillment (pick/ship) | OPS (or 3PL(V)) | OPS | SAL | FIN, DIR |
| Collections / Receipts | FIN | FIN | SAL | DIR |
| Replenishment / Purchasing | OPS | DIR | FIN, SAL | ACC(V) |
| Inventory / Accuracy | OPS (or 3PL(V)) | OPS | FIN | DIR |
| Monthly close + filings | ACC(V) | FIN | DIR | OPS, SAL |
| Support / Returns | Support | OPS | SAL | FIN |

## Outsourced governance (ready-to-run)
### Accounting — ESSENTIAL
- **Objective:** predictable close and filings.
- **Internal owner:** Finance owner.
- **Suggested SLAs:** close by **D+10**; responses in **1 business day**; tax guides with **3 business days** lead time. [ASSUMPTION]
- **Monthly checklist:** reconciliation; taxes; invoicing; expenses; accruals; P&L; open issues.
- **Vendor KPIs:** days to close; rework rate; fines/late filings = 0.

### Warehouse/3PL — if applicable
- **Internal owner:** Ops owner.
- **SLAs:** inventory accuracy; OTIF; damages; ship time.

### Customs broker — if applicable
- **Internal owner:** Ops owner.
- **SLAs:** daily status; documentation alerts; predictable clearance.

## Questions to refine (one round)
1) Besides accounting, do you use a **warehouse/3PL** and/or a **customs broker**? (NONE / 3PL / BROKER / BOTH / NOT SURE)
