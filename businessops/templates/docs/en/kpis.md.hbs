# KPIs & Reporting (Starter)

<!-- BO:BEGIN GENERATED -->
## KPI Principles
- Every KPI has an **owner**, a **formula**, and a **cadence**.
- KPIs should drive decisions, not just reporting.

## KPI Catalog (Starter)
| Area | KPI | Formula | Frequency | Owner | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Finance | Cash balance runway | Cash / Avg monthly burn | Weekly | Finance | 3+ months | Foundational |
| Finance | Gross margin % | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | Monthly | Finance | [ASSUMPTION] | Validate |
| Sales | Pipeline value | Sum of open opps | Weekly | Sales | [ASSUMPTION] | By stage |
| Sales | Conversion rate | Closed won / total opps | Monthly | Sales | [ASSUMPTION] | Track by channel |
| Ops | On-time delivery | Delivered on time / total | Weekly | Ops | 95%+ | If inventory/delivery |
| Ops | Incident rate | Incidents / orders | Weekly | Ops | <2% | Claims & returns |
| Governance | Execution rate | Done actions / planned actions | Weekly | Founder | 80%+ | Drives discipline |

## Reporting Cadence (Starter)
### Weekly
- Cash & receivables
- Sales pipeline
- Operational incidents + delivery status
- Roadmap actions

### Monthly
- Margin analysis
- KPI review
- Process improvement review
- Hiring/people review (if relevant)

## What is missing?
- If KPI values are unknown, mark as **[ASSUMPTION]** and define the measurement plan.
