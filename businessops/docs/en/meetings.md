# Meeting Cadence (Operating Rhythm)

<!-- BO:BEGIN GENERATED -->
## Principles
- Meetings exist to drive decisions, not status updates.
- Every meeting produces action items with owners and due dates.

## Weekly Cadence (ESSENTIAL)

**Participants:** Founder + Sales + Ops + Finance
**Agenda:**
1. Cash + Receivables
2. Sales pipeline & deals at risk
3. Operations incidents / bottlenecks
4. Top risks & blockers
5. Roadmap actions for next week

**Output:** action list + owners + due dates

## Monthly Cadence (RECOMMENDED)

- Process improvements
- Customer issues
- Hiring/roles
